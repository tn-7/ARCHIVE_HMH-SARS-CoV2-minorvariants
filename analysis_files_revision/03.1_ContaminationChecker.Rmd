Quantify reversions.
Delete iSNV reversions (quantify how many there are)
Throw out samples with just 1 iSNV.

Then compound a list of consensus sequence mutations per sample
One hot encoding on what the positional read is.
Add the minor and the major onehot encoding.

Fisher exact test per each report P values
Do this per sequencing run
Repeat this when scrambling sequencing run

JACCARD DISTANCES, baseline model then compare with your actual.

REPORT IT BUT DON'T DO ANYTHING.
